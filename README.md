## about the article:

> The analysis carried out in this paper reveals two most important concepts about frameworks, methodologies and models; the focus area and the full/partial parameter. -- About Software Engineering Frameworks and Methodologies

This article provides an analysis on the definition of software engineering and also the methodologies and frameworks. It gives clear definitions of software engineering concepts. It furthurs its analysis to categorize different methodologies of software development and different frameworks. Through its analysis, it labeled some of most commonly used methodologies and frameworks with different **focus** and **being partial or full** (partial being not supporting a complete software development process). Through the discussion of this paper, we can have a more thorough understanding of software enginneering concepts and usage of different frameworks and methodologies.

### Comment by Anqi Luo (al4951)

This is an interesting analysis on software engineering frameworks, methodologies and models. Most items in the tables of most commonly used software engineering frameworks and methodologies focus in supporting a full development life cycle. This suggests that both rough and specific guidlines of what should be done in the development phases are widely needed, while which kind of guidlines to follow matters to those who value the simplicity in the system design. Consequently, it will be helpful for those people to understand the two highlighted concepts to make use of the frameworks, methodologies and models.
