## about the article:

> The analysis carried out in this paper reveals two most important concepts about frameworks, methodologies and models; the focus area and the full/partial parameter. -- About Software Engineering Frameworks and Methodologies

This article provides an analysis on the definition of software engineering and also the methodologies and frameworks. It gives clear definitions of software engineering concepts. It furthurs its analysis to categorize different methodologies of software development and different frameworks. Through its analysis, it labeled some of most commonly used methodologies and frameworks with different **focus** and **being partial or full** (partial being not supporting a complete software development process). Through the discussion of this paper, we can have a more thorough understanding of software enginneering concepts and usage of different frameworks and methodologies.
